## 1: Sum of All Odd Integers in an Array

Implement a function sumAllOdds(int arr[], int size) which takes an array arr and its size and returns the sum of all the odd integers in the given array.

## 2: Find the Second Minimum in an Array

Implement a function secondMinimum(int arr[], int size) which takes an array arr and its size and returns the second minimum in the given array.

## 3: Square Numbers and Return their Sum

Implement a function `squareSum(float num1, float num2, float num3)` which takes three numbers, square them and returns their sum.

## 4: Overload the Square Sum Function

In the previous challenge, we implemented the function squareSum(float num1, float num2, float num3) which takes three numbers, squares them, and returns their sum. For this challenge, we have to overload this function to take in int type inputs and return int type result. Both of these functions will exist in the same program and depending upon the input type, the appropriate function should be called.

## 5: Halving a Number

You must write the function `halve()` which takes in a `double` pointer and halves the value it points to.

The value should remain half outside the scope of the function as well.

```
*n = 10;
halve(n);
*n == 5 // The value is halved.
```

## 6: Swap Values

You must implement the `swapVals` function which takes in two pointers and swaps the values they point to. The pointers should be of the `integer` type.

```
*p = 10
*q = 20
swap(p, q)
*p == 20
*q == 10
```
